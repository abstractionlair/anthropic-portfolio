## File Movement Plan

### Step 1: Create Portfolio Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p portfolio/tier1_synthesis
mkdir -p portfolio/tier2_technical  
mkdir -p portfolio/tier3_meta
```

### Step 2: Move Selected Conversations
```bash
# Move Tier 1 (5 files)
mv gold_standards/"Multi-Model Dialog on ASI, Safety, and Economics.md" portfolio/tier1_synthesis/
mv gold_standards/"Human Utility as AI Money.md" portfolio/tier1_synthesis/
mv gold_standards/0378_*.md portfolio/tier1_synthesis/
mv gold_standards/0945_*.md portfolio/tier1_synthesis/
mv gold_standards/"Decision Theory and AI Evolution.md" portfolio/tier1_synthesis/

# Move Tier 2 (10 files)
mv gold_standards/"Reasoning Models and Modular Architecture.md" portfolio/tier2_technical/
mv gold_standards/0013_*.md portfolio/tier2_technical/
# ... etc for all Tier 2

# Move Tier 3 (3 files)
# Save current conversation first, then:
mv gold_standards/1252_*.md portfolio/tier3_meta/
mv gold_standards/0415_*.md portfolio/tier3_meta/
```

### Step 3: Move Non-Selected to Candidates
```bash
mkdir candidates
mv gold_standards/*.md candidates/
rmdir gold_standards  # Now empty
```
